                for students that want to reduce their stress levels?</i> </p><br>


                <p>The answer is a robot companion called Hikey. Hikey is meant to first and foremost be a helpful
                companion that enriches facilitates the users experience while hiking alone. Hikey can assist with navigation
                by keeping track of the trail, finding water sources and camp sites. Hikey can also tell the user about
                edible berries and mushrooms, about birds and other things you may encounter in nature.
                This companion can also provide information the user asks for, such as weather, altitude and time.</p>

            <p> In order for Hikey to notice what's around the hiker in a wide field of view, it needs to have a movable head.
                For this, we used our existing clay model and first made a gif to showcase this functionality. We then also
                made the head movable in real time by using some steel wire that passed through the model which the head could
                then rotate around.
            </p>

                <br>
                Hikey can make an array of facial expressions to interact with the user. It can convey emotions such as
                happiness, sadness and anger. It also has an expression for when it is sleeping/powered off as well as
                a neutral expression. The reason we chose to do this is to make Hikey as expressive, compassionate and
                alive as possible.

        <h2>About the project</h2>
        <p> This project was made in group over a span of eight weeks. It consisted of user and literature studies to learn about the
            subject, a design and evaluation phase were several iterations of the concept was made, and lastly a prototyping face.
            The final prototype we produced was a 3D model made in Blender of which you can see renderings of on this page. The
            model was then 3D printed and inserted with an LED programmed with an Arduino to display the different colors Hikey can glow in.
            The demo video below shows how Hikey moves and interacts with the user.
