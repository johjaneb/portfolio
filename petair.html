            <p class="textbox2">Today, pets are considered as important as human
                family members by many. Pets get to follow their owners almost everywhere and
                therefore Volvo is developing a series of products for transporting pets in their cars,
                called PetAir. The project was carried out by me alone working half-time over a span of six months.

                The project begun with researching what types of products that were currently sold on
                the American and Swedish market. Then, the target group was determined and user
                studies including a digital focus group, a survey and a summation of research done by
                Volvo of the US market and the Chinese market was conducted. This constituted the
                information on which the project was built and was compiled into a requirements'
                specification. Based on these requirements I started the design phase. The final concept
                was an inflatable pet carrier built up by a base and an upper
                part that can be used as both a pet bed and a carrier. <br>

            <p class="textbox1">The aim of this project was to develop a product concept f√∂r a transportation cage for
                cats and small dogs weighingtwo to six kilograms. The concept fit in all volvo car models and is
                fastened using seatbelt buckles in any passenger seat. The concept prevent the pet from unwanted
                leaving of the car and can also be carried by pet owners for transportation outside the car.
                </p>

            <img id="uppfalld-bur"src="uppfalldbur2.png" alt="Petair Unfolded sketch">

            <p class="textbox3"> The cage is made up of two individually inflatable parts. The base part is designed as a bed
                and can be used separately for pet owners who prefer not to use a cage or for shorter
                trips for example. The base part has supportive edges for the pet to lean against to increase
                comfort and counteract motion sickness. The upper and base part together form a full carrier that
                does not need to be combined with other products. <br>
                <br>
                When the upper part is not used, it can be deflated and folded in under the base part.
                Worth noting is that the parts are connected by the rear wall to increase the carriers
                strength and stability. The other walls of the base and upper part are attached
                by clickable buckles whose construction resemble a smaller variant of those in one
                seat belt buckle. The concept was evaluated with feedback from some participants in the
                pre-study. The feedback was predominantly positive.</p>
