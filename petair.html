            <p class="textbox2">Today, pets are considered as important as human
                family members by many. Pets get to follow their owners almost everywhere and
                therefore Volvo is developing a series of products for transporting pets in their cars,
                called PetAir.

                The project begun with researching what types of products that were currently sold on
                the American and Swedish market. Then, the target group was determined and user
                studies including a digital focus group, a survey and a summation of research done by
                Volvo of the US market and the Chinese market was conducted. This constituted the
                information on which the project was built and was compiled into a requirements'
                specification. Based on these requirements I started the design phase. The final concept
                was an inflatable pet carrier built up by a base and an upper
                part that can be used as both a pet bed and a carrier. <br>

            <p class="textbox1">Arbetets syfte är att utveckla ett produktkoncept för transport av
                katter och små hundar i viktspannet två till sex kilogram.
                Produkten ska passa i samtliga Volvomodeller och fästas på ett
                passagerarsäte på antingen första eller andra raden. Produkten
                ska hindra djuret från att oönskat lämna bilen samt medge
                transport av djuret utanför bilen.</p>

            <p class="textbox3"> The cage is made up of two individually inflatable parts. The base part is designed as a bed
                and can be used separately for pet owners who prefer not to use a cage or for shorter
                trips for example. The base part has supportive edges for the pet to lean against to increase
                comfort and counteract motion sickness. The upper and base part together form a full carrier that
                does not need to be combined with other products. <br>
                <br>
                When the upper part is not used, it can be deflated and folded in under the base part.
                Worth noting is that the parts are connected on the rear wall to increase the carriers
                strength and stability. The other walls of the base and upper part are attached
                by clickable buckles whose construction resemble a smaller variant of those in one
                seat belt buckle. The concept was evaluated with feedback from some participants in the
                pre-study. The feedback was predominantly positive.</p>
